Greetings! I'm Tabitha, or "Tab" for short. I am a roboticist and Senior Autonomy/Artificial Intelligence Researcher at the [Advanced Technology Center](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space/atc.html) of [Lockheed Martin Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/space.html). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Robotics at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu), where I was a member of the [Intelligent Autonomous Manipulation](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/iam/) group led by [Prof. Oliver Kroemer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/).

During my Ph.D., my [thesis](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/causal-robot-learning-for-manipulation/) focused on causal robot learning for manipulation. Specifically, I investigated the interplay between robot perception and control through the lens of causality to learn and leverage the causal structure of manipulation tasks. To this end, my research built toward a causal robot learning system that empowers lifelong autonomous manipulation in challenging, open-world settings, such as homes, hospitals, and restaurants.

Additionally, I am broadly interested in fundamental robotics and machine intelligence problems that have strong real-world impact, such as those I explored through my prior internships with [NVIDIA's Seattle Robotics Lab](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2020-03_DREAM), Lockheed Martin Space ATC, and Uber ATG.

Prior to my Ph.D., I invented, developed, and deployed a vision-based localization system for an underwater robot that inspects nuclear reactors. This technology was invented through my M.S. in Robotics research with Prof. Nathan Michael and the [Resilient Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.rislab.org/). Before CMU, I led the development of multiple software capabilities for safety-critical autonomous systems in the aerospace industry.

I am also an [RSS Pioneer](https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2024/), an [NCWIT Collegiate Award](https://www.aspirations.org/award-programs/aic-collegiate-award) [Honorable Mention](https://www.aspirations.org/22CollegiateRecipients) recipient, and a [Siebel Scholar in Computer Science](https://www.siebelscholars.com/).

Beyond my technical interests, I am also interested in working towards greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in both academia and society, including ways in which automation can lead to greater societal advancement.
